# MoviesApp
App for test

Missing animations, unit test, video visualization, searching movies/series and dependency injection.
For video visualization it is necessary to storage them in a local storage (Internal o SD card)
Maybe a kind of streaming solution.
For dependency injection, can be with Dagger 2 (not Dagger Hilt for now).
